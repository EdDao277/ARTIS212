      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/icon_1.jpg" />
          <p>
            My first icon represents a cherry blossom tree, a significant tree
            in Japanese culture, with the Japanese flag in the background.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/icon_2.jpg" />
          <p>
            My second icon represents a traditional Japanese gate, also with the
            Japanese flag in the background.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/icon_3.jpg" />
          <p>
            My last icon represents my own story of Lightness and Darkness. It
            is similar to the yin-yang in meaning and appearance.
          </p>

      <h3 call="project_2">Project 2: Digital Posters</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/book_1.jpg" />
          <p>
            My first digital poster, I made the the title based of my first
            icon. The story within is about Hikari's adventure and the
            blossoming of his empire
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/book_2.jpg" />
          <p>
            My second digital poster, the japanese gate goes well with this
            title. Going through the gate is transition from the mundane to
            sacred land. The storie is about the life of this hidden land and
            the transform Yami's viewpoint of his family empire.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="images/book_3.jpg" />
          <p>
            My last digital poster is about the clash between the empire and the
            hidden village. The story is about the brother meeting each other
            and fighting it out because of their different viewpoint. The icon
            goes well with it because the their name meaning is Light and
            Darkness and the icon is a mixed of both.
          </p>

            land and within the story the empire has hard time finding them.
