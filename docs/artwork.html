                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/icon_1.jpg" />
                    <p>My first icon represent a cherry blossom tree, a significant tree of japanese culture. With the japanese flag in the background.</p>

                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/icon_2.jpg" />
                    <p>My second icon represent a traditional japanese gate. Also with the japanese flag in the background.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/icon_3.jpg" />
                    <p>My last icon is my own icon that represent my story of Lightness and Darkness. It is similar to the yin yang in meaning and looks.</p>

        <h3 call="project_2">Project 2: Digital Posters</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/book_1.jpg" />
                    <p>My first digital poster, I made the the title based of my first icon. The story within is about Hikari's adventure and the blossoming of his empire</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/book_2.jpg" />
                    <p>My second digital poster, the japanese gate goes well with this title. Going through the gate is transition from the mundane to sacred land. 
                        The storie is about the life of this hidden land and the transform Yami's viewpoint of his family empire.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/book_3.jpg" />
                    <p>My last digital poster is about the clash between the empire and the hidden village. The story is about the brother meeting each other and fighting it 
                        out because of their different viewpoint. The icon goes well with it because the their name meaning is Light and Darkness and the icon is a mixed of both.</p>
