        <h2>
            About my ARTIS 212 Projects
        </h2>
        <p>
            My ARTIS 212 projects was designed around the story of twin brothers being seperated. The brothers, Hikari and Yami, are japanese prince to an empire. 
            That is in war with neighboring villages. Being seperated at a young age due to war, Hikari has to learn how to become a fit ruler and Yami is taught
            from a different point of view of their empire. I kept a common theme throughout my artwork, with symbols and color that relate to Japan.
