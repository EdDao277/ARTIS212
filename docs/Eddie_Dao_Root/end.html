      After the battle, the village celebrated their freedom, finally liberated
      from the Empire. Yami continued to grieve for his brother and pondered his
      future as the new emperor and how he wished to rule, but he knew something
      needed to change. The day after the celebration, Yami said his goodbyes to
      everyone in the village and led his brother’s soldiers back to the Empire.

      It had been a long time since Yami had been home, and he carried with him
      new ideas for his Empire. He named it <em>Hikari Yami</em>—Light and
      Darkness—an Empire that would rule fairly and peacefully, guiding and
      protecting all people.
