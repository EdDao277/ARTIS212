      During his first year after being kidnapped, Yami was furious and wanted
      to go home, but the people of the Shadow Clan would not allow it. After
      many escape attempts and fits to return home, it became clear that he
      would probably be stuck there forever. Strangely, the Shadow Clan allowed
      Yami to roam their land freely instead of locking him in a cell. The
      villagers and soldiers were kind to him, only keeping an eye on him
      because of his frequent escape attempts. The clan’s kids spent time with
      him and let him play games with them. The elder of the village taught him
      and trained him in their ways.

      Eventually, Yami gained the courage to ask, “Why be so friendly toward an
      enemy of the clan?” The elder responded, “There is no need to be hostile
      to children in a world of war among adults.” He continued his lecture,
      explaining that their sole reason for fighting Yami’s family was survival
      and the protection of their freedom and culture. After hearing this, Yami
      became convinced that his family’s way of ruling was unfair and began to
      accept the ways of the Shadow Clan.

      Over the years, Yami continued training and learning the ways of the clan,
      always wondering about the world outside the village. One day, he asked
      some scouts about the outside world. They told him that his brother had
      taken control of the whole country and was close to discovering their
      location. It was only a matter of time before Hikari found the village.
      When the news reached the elder, every available soldier was ordered to
      prepare for possible warfare. Even Yami took up arms and was willing to
      fight against his brother to help defend the caring village. Moments
      later, the forest caught fire, alerting the village that they had finally
      been discovered.
