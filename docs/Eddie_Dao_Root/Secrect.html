        First year after being kidnapped, Yami was furious and wanted to go home, but the people of the Shadow Clan would not allow that. The many attempts of escaping and fits to return home,
        it became clear that he will probably be stuck here forever. The people of the Shadow Clan are strange though, they allow Yami to roam their land freely and not within a cell of some sort.
        The villager and soldiers are nice to him and only keep an eye him because Yami attempts to escape a lot. The clan's kid spend time with him and allow him to play games with them. The elder
        of the village teaches him and train him in the their ways. Eventually, Yami had the courage to asked, "Why be so friendly toward an enemy of the clan?" The elder responded, "There is no need
        to be hostile to kids in a world of war against adults." The elder continue on his lecture about that topic and brought up that their soul reason of fighting Yami's family is for survival and 
        to proctect their freedom and culture. After hearing all of that Yami was convinced the way that his family been ruling is unfair and willing to accept the Shadow Clan way. Through the years,
        Yami continue training and learning in the way of the Shadow clan wondering how the world outside of this village. Later in the day, Yami asked some of the scouts about the outside world. Telling
        him that his brother has taken control of the whole country and were close to discovering their location. Only in time Hikari will find this village. Once the news reach the elder, every available
        soldiers were made haste to be ready for possible warfare. Even Yami took arms and willing to against his brother to help defend this caring village. Seconds later, the forest caught on fire alerting
        the village that they have been finaly discovered.
