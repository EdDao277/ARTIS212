         The forest fire lighten up the battlefield swords clashing against swords. The Shadow Clan were well prepared for this suprise attack from Hikari. Yami went around the battlefield trying
         to force the soldiers from the empire to stand down by using his family name knowing he outranks everyone. Most of the soldiers were suprised that he was even still alive. Soldiers on both side
         wavered and temporarly stand down. Then, Hikari comes barging through the ranks of his men in anger in why everyone has stopped fighting and met the gaze of his lost brother. Hikari having mix
         reaction between grief and anger, but anger return very quickly when his brother has spoken. Yami tried to convince his brother to leave this village alone and they will not attack and repeat 
         what had happen in the past. Hikari was in disbelief of what his brother had just said to him, angered at how easily Yami could forgive these people for killing their parents. Hikari jumped and 
         striked at his brother. Yami was quick to react and pulled out his swords to block his strike. Hikari was much stronger than Yami, but Yami is not wearing any armor and is quick with his movements.
         They continue striking at each other back and forth, trying to find an opening to strike one down. After, many strikes exchanges Hikari became exhausted from his heavy swings and wearing armor 
         and made more mistakes as they continue fighting. Yami took advantage of that and did quicker strikes to try to finish the fight soon. With one quick final blow Yami was able to take out his brother.
         Ending his last living family member.
