      The forest fire lit up the battlefield, swords clashing against swords.
      The Shadow Clan were well prepared for this surprise attack from Hikari.
      Yami moved through the battlefield, trying to force the soldiers of the
      Empire to stand down by invoking his family name, knowing he outranked
      everyone. Many soldiers were surprised that he was even still alive.
      Soldiers on both sides wavered and temporarily stood down.

      Then Hikari came barging through the ranks of his men, furious that
      everyone had stopped fighting. He met the gaze of his lost brother, his
      emotions torn between grief and anger—but anger returned quickly once Yami
      spoke. Yami tried to convince his brother to leave the village alone,
      promising that they would not attack or repeat the mistakes of the past.
      Hikari was in disbelief at what his brother said, enraged at how easily
      Yami could forgive those who had killed their parents.

      In a fury, Hikari struck at his brother. Yami reacted quickly, pulling out
      his swords to block. Hikari was stronger, but weighed down by armor and
      heavy swings. Yami, unarmored, was faster and more agile. They exchanged
      blow after blow, searching for an opening to end the fight. After many
      exchanged strikes, Hikari grew exhausted from his strength-draining
      attacks and armor, making more mistakes as the duel dragged on. Yami
      seized the chance, delivering swift strikes to turn the tide. With one
      final, decisive blow, Yami struck down his brother—ending the life of his
      last living family member.
