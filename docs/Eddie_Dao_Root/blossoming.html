        The ruling family of the Empire took a huge toll. The emperor and empress were assassinated and one of the prince were kidnapped by the Shadow Clan. Leaving behind only Hikari to rule the 
        growing empire. The death of the emporor and empress left the empire in turmoil, more war broke out and leaving the empire that Hikari's father left behind in crumbles. Hikari was fueled 
        by hatred towards the Shadow Clan and wished to rebuild what his father had create for him and his brother. This led Hikari to be pushed to finish his studies and master the art of the 
        sword to be able to become a emporor like his father. Once Hikari became a rightful ruler, he had a lot of work to do to achieve his revenge for his family. He will have to reunite
        the empire and take back the land that was lost to reballions. After succeeding in his conquest of regaining control over his empire, there is nothing stopping him from getting revenge.
        His motivation of revenge made him become an ambitous ruler and laid claimed to the rest of the land in the country in hope to destroy the Shadow Clan. There was no luck in finding the 
        Shadow Clan, it is as if they never existed because Hikari has taken over the whole country in search for them, but never found an army that fights like them. Upset, Hikari made a bounty
        over the Shadow Clan if any can find their land will be rewarded. Hikari now waits within his throne room in hope for them to be found.
