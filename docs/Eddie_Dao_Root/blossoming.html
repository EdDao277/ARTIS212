      The ruling family of the Empire suffered a huge toll: the emperor and
      empress were assassinated, and one of the princes was kidnapped by the
      Shadow Clan, leaving only Hikari to rule the growing Empire. The deaths of
      the emperor and empress plunged the Empire into turmoil. More wars broke
      out, leaving the realm Hikari’s father built in ruins. Driven by hatred
      toward the Shadow Clan, Hikari vowed to rebuild what his father had
      created for him and his brother.

      This pushed Hikari to finish his studies and master the art of the sword
      so he could become an emperor like his father. Once Hikari became the
      rightful ruler, he set out to avenge his family. He would have to reunite
      the Empire and take back the lands lost to rebellions. After regaining
      control over his Empire, nothing seemed to stand in his way.

      His desire for revenge made him an ambitious ruler. He laid claim to the
      rest of the land in the hope of destroying the Shadow Clan. Yet there was
      no sign of them; it was as if they had never existed. Although Hikari took
      over the whole country in his search, he never found an army that fought
      like them. Frustrated, Hikari placed a bounty on the Shadow Clan—anyone
      who could find their land would be rewarded. Now Hikari waits in his
      throne room, hoping they will be found.
